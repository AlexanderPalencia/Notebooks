POI (Proof of Importance)
 POI system not only rewards those with a large account balance, but also takes into account how much they transact to others and who they transact with.
 Quiere decir que entre mas activo en NEM, ayudando la economia de NEM son compensados. a cada usuario se le asigna un trust score entre mas alto mas posibilidad hay que te toque minar.
 mean much more even wealth distribution; anyone who contributes can gain extra XEM (the currency of the NEM network). NEM is great because it gives similar opportunities to everyone. The main aim is to empower regular people.
Harvesting: mining blocks , a process in which a node will calculate blocks and they are added to the blockchain.. you collect fees
importance in the network is the trust score. calculated base on how much you use the network
Pol?

Vesting (conferir): When a person first deposits XEM into an account, none of it will be vested. After 24 hours, 10% of the balance becomes vested and so on. The point of this is to build up trust
Once you have enough vested coins, you can mine either through local harvesting or delegated harvesting.

Mosaics: Permite la realizacion de muchas funcionalidades de la blockchain
mosaics allow new levels of blockchain utility and versatility.  A mosaic is like a file hosted on a domain and represents an asset, and like a website and directory, a mosaic can have the same name as other files on other domains. 
 namespace + mosaic will always be unique. mosaics is like token have the characteristic of divisibility, mutable quantity, transferability

Namespaces: is unique in the net of NEM,  namespaces can have sub-namespaces.Namespaces can have up to 3 levels, a namespace and its two levels of sub-namespace domains.top level namespace has a size limit of 16 characters, sub-namespaces have a limit of 64 characters. 


Smart Contracts
NEM is a flexible blockchain technology. Instead of uploading all the application logic into the blockchain, you can use its tested features through API calls for transfer and storage of value, authorization, traceability, and identification.

The rest of the code remains off-chain. This reduces the inherent immutability risk, as you could change the process when necessary.
